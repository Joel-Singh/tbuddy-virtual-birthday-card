        Tionna, <br>
        <br>

        I hope you have enjoyed your first year in college and I wanted to congratulate you for all the accomplishments and friends that you've made in such a compact amount of time. You have such a bright, comedic, and enthusiastic spirit, and I hope that you never lose such a valuable thing. I wish you nothing but the best for this next year of your life and for every single one the follows. Happy birthday! <br>
